# NandGame FPGA Project

Objective : This project is for me to learn VHDL.

The inspiration came from the logic game [NandGame](https://www.nandgame.com/). Why not learn about computer architecture and gain VHDL knowledge at the same time?

The FPGA board used is a [Basys3](https://digilent.com/reference/programmable-logic/basys-3/start) by Digilent programmed in [AMD Vivado 2024.1](https://www.amd.com/en/products/software/adaptive-socs-and-fpgas/vivado.html)

This is also my first time using Git to manage my project.
